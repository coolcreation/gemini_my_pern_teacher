git commit -m "initial commit: add a new Pern project with Gemini as my guide!"


To Gemini:
Can you give me a challenge, a step by step tutorial on how to build an ecommerce website using postgresql, react, and node.js which 
only gives me a small piece of the puzzle at any one given point in time and allows me to move to the next step after completing the 
previous task? I really want you to be my teacher
